        <p>Hey everyone! I'm Rachel and I attend North Dakota State University while I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Architecture and a minor in Graphic Design. While I do this, I also work at the two greatest boutiques in the world called <em>Onyx and Pearl</em> and <em>Mint and Basil!</em> Besides that, I enjoy playing with my puppy, exploring, creating social media content, and being a brand ambassador. I look forward to showing you more about my life!</p>
